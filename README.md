Due to Spotify's updated authentication system, you'll need to provide your `sp_dc` cookie:

1. **Get your sp_dc cookie:**
   - Go to [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com) in your browser
   - Log in to your Spotify account
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí https://open.spotify.com
   - Find the `sp_dc` cookie and copy its value

2. **Set the cookie:**
   - Add `SP_DC=your_cookie_value` to your `.env` file, or
   - Set it as an environment variable: `export SP_DC=your_cookie_value`


### Building

- Clone the repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Delitefully/spotify-canvas-downloader
  ```
- Configure the env variables
  ```sh
  mv env.example .env
  # Add your SP_DC cookie to the .env file
  ```
- Build the image using Docker Compose
  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

### Development
